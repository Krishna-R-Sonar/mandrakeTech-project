# Telosa Reviews Full-Stack Application

This repository contains a full-stack application with a responsive frontend built using **Vite + React** and **Bootstrap CSS**, and a backend built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB** for user authentication (sign up/sign in).

> **Note:**  
> I have not connected the backend with the frontend yet, but this repo includes a complete backend folder with all files for user sign up/sign in logic.  
> **IMPORTANT:** Before running the backend, enter your MongoDB URI and JWT secret in the environment variables.
